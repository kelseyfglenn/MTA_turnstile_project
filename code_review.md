## Clean Code:
* Follows PEP-8 for the most part
* Limited redundancy and relatively clear variable names
* Effective use of function and .apply to manipulate data

## Good Documentation:
* Suggest additional explanation of analysis and thoughts via markdown
* Be sure to check for typos in your readme

## Proper Data Science:
* Clear visualizations, could use some explanation
* Thorough investigation of outliers and anomalies, though it would be nice to see some explanation of why super-high traffic was unrealistic or undesirable
* Explored several outside data sources

## Comments:
* Quite thorough and pretty clean code (despite limited use of functions)
* It'd be nice to see some additional explanation inside of the notebooks via markdown
